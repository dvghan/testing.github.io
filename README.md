Python Developer | Exploring Web Development & Microservices</p>

        Hi, I’m Dnyanesh — a Python developer currently expanding my skills into web development.
        I have a solid understanding of HTML and CSS, and I’m now diving deeper into creating 
        modern, interactive web apps. Lately, I’ve been exploring microservices architecture using 
        Python FastAPI to build scalable, efficient solutions.
